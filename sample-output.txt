O truant Muse what be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
dost thou too, and therein dignified.
Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply 
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed;
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
But best is best, if never intermixed'?
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Excuse not for't lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
   Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
   To make him long hence, as he now.
