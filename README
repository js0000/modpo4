This code came to be written because I was assigned to do some writing in the
Modern and Contemporary Poetry Massive Open Online Course I took the time to
participate in. The assignment had two parts, but only one of them needed to be
done. So I chose one of the parts and did it.


    Systematically eliminate the use of certain kinds of words or phrases from
    a piece of writing: for example, eliminate all adjectives from a poem of
    your own or another poem, for example a poem in our course; or take out all
    words beginning with 's' in one or several of Shakespeare's sonnets or any
    poem or poems from our course.


This writing prompt was taken from Bernadette Mayer's Writing Experiments which
can be found if you have the appropriate technology at the following address:
http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Mayer-Bernadette_Experiments.html 

In response to this prompt I wrote a short program. Nothing personal, but it
takes 2 arguments:

 1. -f <File name and (if needed) path>
 2. -l <initial Letter of words to be removed> 
    [if this is not passed in, it will be randomly assigned]

So, to run this program on a sonnet by Shakespeare in order to remove all words
begining with 's', the command line would be:
bmwe2a.pl -f sonnet-101.txt -l s
